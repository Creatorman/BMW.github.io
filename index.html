<p>The official founding date of the German motor vehicle manufacturer BMW is 7 March 1916, when an aircraft engine manufacturer called Bayerische Flugzeugwerke AG was formed.<br>
     This company was renamed to Bayerische Motoren Werke (BMW) in 1922. <br>
      However the name BMW dates back to 1913, when the original company to use the name BMW was born (initially as Rapp Motorenwerke).<br>
       BMW's first product was a straight-six aircraft engine called the BMW IIIa.<br>
        Following the end of World War I, BMW remained in business by producing motorcycle engines, farm equipment, household items and railway brakes.<br>
         The company produced its first motorcycle, the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BMW_R32">BMW R 32</a> in 1923.<br> </p>

         <h5 class="bold left">BMW R32 - the engine had a displacement of 494 cc and produced 8.5 hp.</h5> <br>
        <p> BMW became an automobile manufacturer in 1928 when it purchased Fahrzeugfabrik Eisenach, which, at the time, built Austin Sevens under licence under the Dixi marque.<br>
        The first car sold as a BMW was a rebadged Dixi called the <a href="https://pl.wikipedia.org/wiki/BMW_3/15">BMW 3/15</a>.<br> </p>

     <h5 class="bold left">BMW Roadster 3/15 (15 hp)</h5> <br> <br>
        <p> Throughout the 1930s, BMW expanded its range into sports cars and larger luxury cars.<br>
        Aircraft engines, motorcycles, and automobiles would be BMW's main products until World War II.<br>
         During the war, against the wishes of its director Franz Josef Popp, BMW concentrated on aircraft engine production, with motorcycles as a side line and automobile manufacture stopped altogether.<br>
          BMW's factories were heavily bombed during the war and its remaining West German facilities were banned from producing motor vehicles or aircraft after the war. Again, the company survived by making pots, pans, and bicycles.<br>
           In 1948, BMW restarted motorcycle production.<br>
            BMW resumed car production in Bavaria in 1952 with the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BMW_501">BMW 501</a> luxury saloon.<br> </p>
            <img class="serie" src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/35/BMW_501_V8_Cabriolet_vr.jpg" alt="BMW 501 luxury saloon">
            <h5 class="bold left">The BMW 502 was the first postwar German car to be manufactured with a V8 engine.</h5> <br>
            <p> The range of cars was expanded in 1955, through the production of the cheaper Isetta microcar under licence.<br>
              Slow sales of luxury cars and small profit margins from microcars meant BMW was in serious financial trouble and in 1959 the company was nearly taken over by rival Daimler-Benz.<br>
               A large investment in BMW by Herbert Quandt and Harald Quandt resulted in the company surviving as a separate entity.<br>
            The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BMW_700">BMW 700</a> was successful and assisted in the company's recovery.<br> </p>

<p>The BMW 1 Series is a range of subcompact executive cars (C-segment) manufactured by BMW since 2004. It is the successor to the BMW 3 Series Compact and is currently in its second generation.

        The first generation was produced in hatchback, coupe and convertible body styles. Since the second generation (introduced in 2013), the coupé and convertible models have been marketed as the 2 Series, therefore the 1 Series range no longer includes these body styles. A sedan model became available for the Chinese market in 2017.
        
        The 1 Series is BMW's entry level of model range. Unusually for a small car, the 1 Series range is mostly rear-wheel drive, (except for the F52 sedan, which is front-wheel drive) with optional all-wheel drive being available on some models.
        
        An M version was produced for the first generation: the BMW 1 Series M Coupe, which was succeeded by the BMW M2.</p>
<br>

<p>The BMW 2 Series is a subcompact executive car (C-segment) produced by BMW. The 2 Series has several different body styles. It is available as a compact coupé that replaced the 1 Series coupé, or as a convertible model that replaces the 1 Series convertible in the BMW lineup. There is also a new compact MPV body style, which BMW refers to as an Active Tourer.

        The 2 Series Active Tourer mechanicals are unrelated to the coupé and convertible models'. While it shares the 2 Series name, it is built on a totally different front wheel drive platform that is shared with the third generation MINI Cooper, dubbed UKL1.
        
        The 2 Series currently competes with new models from Audi and Mercedes-Benz, the A3 Sedan and the CLA Class, respectively, until BMW releases its own front wheel drive/all wheel drive compact sedan. In June 2015, BMW also released a seven seater 2 Series Gran Tourer.</p>

<p>The BMW 3 Series is a compact executive car manufactured by the German automaker BMW since May 1975. It is the successor to the 02 Series and has been produced in seven different generations.

        The first generation of the 3 Series was only available as a 2-door sedan (saloon), however the model range has since expanded to include a 4-door sedan, 2-door convertible, 2-door coupé, 5-door station wagon, 5-door hatchback ("Gran Turismo") and 3-door hatchback body styles. Since 2013, the coupé and convertible models have been marketed as the 4 Series, therefore the 3 Series range no longer includes these body styles.
        
        The 3 Series is BMW's best-selling model, accounting for around 30% of the BMW brand's annual total sales (excluding motorbikes).[1] The BMW 3 Series has won numerous awards throughout its history.
        
        The M version of the 3 series, M3, debuted with the E30 M3 in 1986.</p>

<p>The BMW 4 Series is a range of coupé, convertible and fastback models manufactured by the German automaker BMW since 2013. It was unveiled at the North American International Auto Show in January 2013 in Detroit.

        The 4 Series was created when BMW spun off the 3 Series 2-door models (coupé and convertible) into a separate series. In 2014, the "4 Series Gran Coupé" 4-door fastback body style was added to the range.</p>

<p>The BMW 5 Series is an executive car manufactured by BMW since 1972. It is the successor to the New Class Sedans and is currently in its seventh generation.

        Initially, the 5 Series was only available in a sedan body style. The wagon/estate body style (called "Touring") was added in 1991 and the 5-door fastback (called "Gran Turismo") was produced from 2009 to 2017.
        
        The first generation of 5 Series was powered by naturally aspirated four-cylinder and six-cylinder petrol engines. Following generations have been powered by four-cylinder, six-cylinder, V8 and V10 engines that are either naturally aspirated or turbocharged. Since 1982, diesel engines have been included in the 5 Series range.
        
        The 5 Series is BMW's second best-selling model after the 3 Series. On January 29, 2008, the 5 millionth 5 Series was manufactured, a 530d sedan in Carbon Black Metallic.
        
        BMW's three-digit model naming convention began with the first 5 Series, thus the 5 Series was BMW's first model line to use "Series" in the name.
        
        Since the E28, all generations of 5 Series have included an "M" model, called the BMW M5.</p>

<p>The BMW 6 Series is a range of grand tourers produced by BMW since 1976. It is the successor to the E9 Coupé and is currently in its fourth generation.

                The first generation BMW E24 6 Series was available solely as a two-door coupé and produced from 1976 to 1989, then it was supplanted by the BMW 8 Series (E31) although the latter had a substantially higher price and performance. When the 6 Series nameplate was revived in 2004 for the second generation, the BMW E63/E64 6 Series, the coupé was joined by a convertible body style. The third generation F06/F12/F13 6 Series debuted in 2011 as a coupé and convertible, and added a four-door coupé body style (known as the Gran Coupé) in 2012. When the F06/F12/F13 6 Series ended production, the "Gran Coupé"/coupé/convertible models have been shifted into the more upmarket BMW 8 Series (G15) nameplate. The fourth generation 6 Series, the G32 6 Series, debuted in mid-2017 and is offered only as a fastback body style to complement the BMW 5 Series (G30) sedan/wagon.
                
                The first generation 6 Series was derived from the BMW E23 7 Series, and was powered by a range of naturally aspirated inline-six gasoline engines. Following generations have been powered by inline-four, V8, and V10 engines with both natural aspiration and turbocharging. Since 2008, diesel engines have been included in the 6 Series range, with four-wheel drive models on offer since 2012.
                
                Since the first generation BMW E24 6 Series in 1983, all models have been offered with a high-performance M variant.</p>

<p>The BMW 7 Series is a full-size luxury sedan produced by the German automaker BMW since 1977. It is the successor to the BMW E3 "New Six" sedan and is currently in its sixth generation.

                The 7 Series is BMW's flagship car and is only available in a saloon bodystyle (including long wheelbase and limousine models). It traditionally introduces technologies and exterior design themes before they trickle down to other models in BMW's lineup.
                
                The first generation of the 7 Series was powered by straight-6 petrol engines, and following generations have been powered by inline-4, straight-6, V8 and V12 engines with both natural aspiration and turbocharging. Since 1995, diesel engines have been optional in the 7 Series.
                
                Unlike the 3 Series and 5 Series saloons, BMW has not produced a M model for the 7 Series (i.e. an "M7"). However, in 2014 an "M Performance" option became available for the 7 Series.</p>

<p>The BMW 8 Series is a range of grand tourers produced by BMW.

                The 8 Series was introduced in 1990 under the E31 model code and was only available as a two-door coupé. It is powered by a range of naturally aspirated V8 and V12 petrol engines. The E31 started production just as E24 6 Series production ended, however it is not considered a direct successor. It was later discontinued in 1999 due to poor sales.
                
                The model range was later reintroduced in 2018 with the second generation, G15 8 Series. It is expected to launch in coupé (G15), convertible (G14), and four-door Gran Coupé (G16) body styles, as the successor to the F06/F12/F13 6 Series lineup. The G15 8 Series introduces an inline-six diesel engine, and a high-performance M8 model is also expected to be launched in the future.</p>
